# Full-Stack Utils

## Desciption
In this tutorial, I will go threw any tools I use to start an end to end project from scratch.


## UI/UX And Styling

before you start develop the frontend ui, It is a good idea to already know how it is suppose to look and behave.
If you are like me and you are not a designer but yet need to deal with desisns yourself, these tools would be a good place to start.

### 1. Dribbble

[Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/) is a website filled with insperational web and mobile designs, and you can find site with similar topic or subject to yours, to get a clearer idea about how you want your site to look.

It is always a good idea to check for similar sites too.

### 2. Coolors

[Coolors](https://coolors.co/) is a website for color palletes, you can generate a costum one or use existing / trending palletes.

As mentioned, I am not a designer so I choose from the existing ones.

Note: It is worth spending a hour or two looking at ui/ux videos to get a better understanding how to use palletes, the 60/30/10 rull, call to action etc.

### 3. ShapeDivider
[ShapeDivider](https://www.shapedivider.app/) is used for generating element shapes, mainly used to divide the sections in your UI and give a more intersting flow to the site.

## Database

### 1. dbdiagram
[dbdiagram](http://dbdiagram.io) is great way to generate a visual relational schemes before starting to build the database itself.
After implementing, you can generate a SQL file with all the queries neede to to start the database.
